# ezBIDS
The cloud-based graphical user interface for automated DICOM to BIDS data ingestion

### About
This is the developmental repo for an automated [BIDS](https://bids.neuroimaging.io/) converter web service that allows users to upload a directory containing 
DICOM files, and analyze the directory structure and sidecars generated from dcm2niix in order to *infer* 
as much information about the data structure as possible. Users are then asked to verify/modify
those assumptions before generating the final BIDS structure. Users do not need to organize their DICOM directory in any manner. 

In lieu of DICOMs, users may upload a directory containing the NIFTI/JSON files generated by dcm2niix instead, if they do not have access to the raw DICOMs.

Unlike other automated DICOM to BIDS converters, ezBIDS eliminates the need for the command line and heuristic/configuration file setup.

The BIDS output can be downloaded back to the user's computer, or uploaded to open repositories such as
[OpenNeuro](https://openneuro.org/), or [brainlife.io](https://brainlife.io/)

ezBIDS accepts DICOMS from the three major MRI vendors: **Siemens**, **GE**, and **Phillips**
